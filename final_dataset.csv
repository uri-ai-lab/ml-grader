154,"I would tell my friends that choosing organic would be the best decision because it is much healthier for you - there as less chemical used in the process, less pesticides, and it is supporting our local farmers. ",25
170,Conventional because it is more accommodating and less expensive.,15
11,"While both sides had good points, I would say that inorganic farming may be slightly better due to the fact that much more land is needed for organic farming, that organic farming may not be able to sustain the growing population, and that organic farming may have equal, if not worse, effects on the environment in certain ways.",25
88,"With an ever increasing population, it seems as though it would be impossible to completely supply the sustenance for the entire world through organic farming. I think a combination between organic and conventional techniques would need to be utilized in order to preserve our environment while also allowing for enough crop yield to feed the human population. Some conventional farms are able to skyrocket their yields by use of synthetic chemicals, fertilizers, and inhumane means. Unfortunately, this is necessary to a certain extent to feed the overpopulated world. At what cost though? I think certain techniques such as crop rotation, minimization of chemicals, and sustainable practices should be utilized. They should be utilized particularly by the large corporations that produce the majority of the food because of their proportional impact. However, if I am honest, I eat organic foods for a vast majority of my diet due to personal beliefs.",5
187,They should just buy food separately from now on. Neither of them are right or wrong they can eat the foods that they want to eat regardless of health benefits or cost. ,0
193,The best option to tell my friends is to start thinking about food choices more critically because it can be beneficial for them and the environment.,0
101,"Based on the information provided in the video it was clear that the purpose of the video was to persuade you that organic farming is not only the right method of farming as it was the initial method of farm in the early stages but also econ-friendly because there are no pesticides to harms animals within the field. another premises of the supported claim is that organic farm's good for fighting climate change. with all that information given, i would have to say organic farming is the way to go and i'm all for. ",25
23,I think eating organic food is the best option. Because I think they have fewer preservatives and chemicals. ,20
159,"Based on what I heard in the videos, I would tell my friends that organic farming is more detrimental than it is helpful. The foods are more expensive, take longer, and do not yield as many products. This is a problem, as our population continues to grow every year. In addition, organic farming uses up much more land than industrial farming which is very harmful for the environment and causes more issues. Lastly, it costs more money because more workers are needed. ",25
78,"Organic because although more expensive, the less pesticides you are putting in your food the more you are helping your long term health. ",25
146,"I would tell my friends that we should gradually start switching to organic foods, starting with fruits, vegetables, and meats. ",10
75,Organic because they are generally healthier food.,15
118,Organic farming is very beneficial for the environment and it is important to note when purchasing food items compared to GMO's ,20
100,"Organic farming, because they cannot use conventional pesticides, it is more sustainable, and healthier as well.",25
96,"The best option is organic, if they can afford it.",15
68,based on what I have heard i would tell my friends that going organic is better.  it is essentially healthier but its more expensive,20
8,"I would personally tell them that if they want to eat organic foods but can't afford it, that they should try to grow it themselves. ",0
216,"I think choosing to go organic with only the dirty dozen is a good idea for college students. Buying everything organic is difficult because of the expense, but it does ensure that your are not getting anything that you are not supposed to be.",15
190,"I would tell my friends organic farming is the better option because it has much less additives and pesticides that are harmful to people. Although it requires more work and land, I feel that it is worth the extra effort. I personally feel that I would rather eat foods that were grown in a more natural way even if means paying slightly more. I think that organic foods are much healthier in the long run and we can avoid many diseases by consuming organic foods. Although it may be more difficult to produce and care for the organic foods, I think that it is all worth it in the end and therefore the better option. ",20
62,The best option is going organic because it maintains biodiversity. It also uses less pesticides and hardly an chemicals.,25
133,Organic because it healthier to eat foods with less chemicals.,20
26,"Eat less beef and eat more sustainable foods like chicken or, if they are up for it, try vegetarianism",0
175,I think organic farming is the way to go because it is a more humane way of handling animals while still producing the same products. ,15
218,"I would say the use of organic farming. Since organic food production avoids the use of chemicals, it doesn't show any risk of soil and underground water contamination, unlike the other farming",25
16,"The best option would be organic farming as it is the most natural way of farming. There are no herbicides, pesticides or fertilizer used. In organic farming manure is used as fertilizer, the farm is weeded instead of sprayed with pesticides, and the ecosystem is healthier with more animals from bees to foxes, making the farming process far more natural and healthy.  ",25
2,"I woud tell my friend that the best option would be organic farming. While it takes much more work and is more difficult than regular farming, organic foods are healthier for humans to consume. These foods have more nutritional value and they are free of GMOs while also not being harmful to the planet. The main con to organic farming would be that is it a lot more expensive, but in the long run I believe organic farming is the better option. ",30
224,"Organic, because it has no chemicals and less pesticides ",20
116,"I would tell my friends that both of them are right in part, but that they should both do some research concerning the other point of view. Organic farming is a great practice in theory but cannot sustain the ever growing population, but that also doesn't mean it is everything it claims to be. Do the research, and make the best decision for themselves.",5
161,"I would tell my friends that organic farming is much more beneficial for us to eat and better for the environment (less pesticides) but with the constant increase of people in our world, it may not be the smartest/most sustainable option. ",25
211,"As we are college kids, I'd tell them the best option is conventional, because it will be easier for us to afford more food.",15
30,"I wuold be honest wiht my friens, wihout trying to hurt their feelings but by also getting my point across",0
50,I would tell them to ask politely if they could just pay for their own organic food and you pay your own food since you don't eat that type of food so you shouldn't have to pay more. ,0
141,I would tell my friends that the best option is organic farming because I think that the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I do not think that the increased methane that cows produce in organic farming is that harmful to the environment. I think that conventional farming leaves a bigger impact on the enviornment. ,20
92,I would say organic because it's cheaper.,15
67,"I would say the best option is a mixture between orgainc farming and conventional farming because even though organic farming is better for biodiversity, organic farming alone is not practical and would not provide enough for the eight billion people on the planet. ",5
32,"Based on what I head in the videos i would choose the first choice in the first video.Their argument was most relatable and made the most sense
",10
219,"I would tell them that organic foods are better due to the fact there are not as many chemicals used, but to look out and do some research about the organic company first.",15
46,"I don't know, both have their pros and cons. Depends on the friend. If their more environmentally conscious, go organic. If they don't want to spend a lot, use conventional foods.",5
157,"I believe I would tell my friends that organic farming is the best option. Although the videos poked holes in some of the topics within organic farming such as the use of pesticides, I still believe organic farming is the safer option. For starters, even if organic farming does use pesticides, the risk of developing illness is much lower than conventional. Pesticides have been linked to cancers and putting the best possible ingredients in your body is my belief, as I am studying to be a nurse. I also think in terms of livestock, it is extremely important to pick organic meats as conventional slaughter houses are known to be in horrendous conditions and the quality of meat is very low. ",20
184,I would say eating green. Cutting out red meat or even trying to fund snd support farms like Farm Fair Oaks.,0
176,"I would probably tell my friends that organic farming is great in theory, but just not possible for the number of people of Earth. It also sounds like organic farming is worse for the environment than conventional farming methods",25
123,"Although organic farming may not produce as big of a crop yield than conventional farming, it focuses on sustainability of the environment which I believe is more important. Organic farming doesn't use chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides or feed additives for livestock. The manure produced by cows specifically is used to recycle waste and improve the soil structure. Other factors such as weeding...the preferred organic farming, may mean that it is more labor intensive but makes more jobs available‚Ä¶more economically friendly and chemical free. Overall, organic farming is the best option because it helps to maintain the biodiversity better rather than conventional farming because fewer chemicals are used. ",30
144,"I would tell them to choose organic farming because it has many positives, and they seem to outweigh the negatives.",10
98,I would tell my friends the best option is to go organic. Although it is more expensive in the end it is much healthier for you. Not only that you are supporting local farms.,25
89,To try and not buy meat items made in factories because they do not use natural alternatives which is harmful to our planet.,0
148,"I would tell my friends to be wary of foods labeled ""organic"" because the label doesn't necessarily mean ""healthier"" or ""better"" for you. The organic farming process does use more natural sources and more environmentally efficient sources however they typically can't afford for an actual FDA organic sticker, but other products that still technically meet organic requirements may refer to themselves as ""organic"" but really it's ingredients and amounts of things that you want to look at when deciding what foods to buy, not whether they are called organic or not. ",0
150,"I personally believe that an organic lifestyle is best because despite the differences in pricing between organic and conventional, your body will thank you in the long run for the benefits organic foods have.",20
20,"I would say organic food is better because even in real life I try to eat organic as much as possible. I love eating healthy and even though it may be a little more expensive, I love the organic foods that I buy. ",25
220,Organic farming because it uses less pesticides and chemicals and maintains biodiversity,20
205,conventional because you can be healthy without having to buy more expensive foods,20
87,"The best option would be to eat organically because although it may be a little more expensive and harder to find, it is healthier for the body and does not contain hazardous chemicals and pesticides. ",20
51,Organic farming because it is better for the health and for the environment ,20
115,"I would tell my friends that the best option is to choose locally grown, organic foods. the pros outweigh the cons. For people in the same socioeconomic class as me and my friends, we are not really aware of the benefits of eating locally grown foods - only that they don't fit into our budgets when grocery shopping. but not I know that an investment made into local farming will not only benefit our health, but also our local economies potentially making organic foods more popular and more available for those who may not be able to afford them",25
44,"The organic option is better for ones health and environment. Although it is more expensive, in the long run it makes more sense.",25
165,I would say conventional farming due to the fact that they  are able to chose between organic fertilizers or conventional. I also thing organic farming is riskier because if they don't use pesticides and other additives the yield won't be enough- therefore there is a 99.9% chance that when you eat organic foods they have been modified.,15
208,"Based on what I heard in the videos, its not really ""better"" to buy organic food.  is it healthier, yes but they still can us gmos.  I think that the best option is to buy some of your products organic and some not, that way it's not too expensive to take on.",5
147,I would tell my friends to choose organic farming. I already eat a to of organic foods and truly feel a difference when consuming them. I think paying more is okay when you're getting the highest quality of food.,20
6,"I believe organic food is better despite being more expensive. If we continue to buy from large companies who raise their animals in tiny boxes and feed them preservatives, they will continue to treat animals unjustly.  ",20
5,"Going organic is a healthier alternative, then eating non-organic. Everything organic is made straight up, and with no GMO's",20
107,I would say that eating organically would be the best option because it is so much better for you and the environment.,20
156,"Organic, its healthier and better for the environment. if they can afford to eat organically, I believe they should try. ",20
14,If they can afford organic definitely go organic because pesticides cann cause cancer.,15
134,"Organic is healthy, however, may cost more than general foods. Organic food production is good for the environment",25
177,"Conventional meat eating, because it maintains biodiversity, and if eaten organically, doesn't include chemicals.",0
207,"I would tell my friends that conventional farming was better because it yields more food (which we need with a growing population) and it uses less land so we don't have to clear as much vegetation/forests. However, I would say that some changes need to be made to conventional farming such as using pesticides that are less harmful and also cutting down on livestock farming and focusing more on crops.",25
84,"Organic. Because there is no pesticides, no chemicals, maintains biodiveristy, and lower yields. ",25
160,"I would probably say that organic foods aren't worth it. Especially on a larger scale, the whole planet would not be able to eat organically since the yield is so low. Plus, they still use pesticides so how organic is it really? ",20
137,"I think that buying local, organic foods are the best option because theyre fresher, better for us and better for the environment. ",25
119,i would say organic food is healthier for us and the environment ,20
64,"I feel that a meatless diet would be best due to the lack of pesticides and chemicals, and it maintains biodiversity.",0
95,I would tell my friends to only buy organic items if they know they are safer but otherwise I would recommend regular produce as long as you check the labels and they are affordable. ,5
213,"I would eat organic foods. Even though they are more expensive, they are made without artificial chemicals.",20
158,"I would say go organic because eating meat is a great source of protein and something that has always been done. Once we take eating meat out of diets, we lose a lot of essential nutrients",10
45,I would tell my friends that eating organic meal choices can benefit more than non-organic due to the freshness and quality of the food. They also contain fewer pesticides and are better for the environment. I would consider eating organic foods more often.,25
227,Everyone in part should do research until a decision is made.  I believe conventual is the same nutrients than organic.,0
197,"Organic food refers to the way farmers grow and process products with reducing pollution, enhancing soil and water quality, and promoting a healthy living condition. However, I would say that you do not have to insist on eating organic food because it is the same with regular food nutritionally. ",5
212,i would tell my friends that it would be the best option to buy organic food because it is better for you because it has no pesticides and no chemicals. ,25
12,"The best option is to eat organic because it has no chemicals and fewer pesticides, and is healthy for you and the environment. ",25
22,"I would choose organic farming because it has many beneficial effects, including being better for the environment, and not utilizing chemicals or pesticide.",25
182,I think to conventional farming is better because it takes up less land and has a bigger yield than organic farming. Scientists also say that the pesticides used are not extremely harmful to the human  body and that the cows in organic farming produce a large amount of green house gases.,25
166,I would tell them that they should consider to just stick with the conventional food. The conventional food may not b healthier for you and might have more chemicals or pesticides but it is cheaper and with organic food you can't even know for sure how chemical free it actually is every organic food has different percents. Living in house with two other people you need to consider how much you are affecting everyone in the house with your diet change and how much more we would be spending on grocies.,25
39,I would tell my friends that organic farming is the better choice to use because it is more natural and you actually know what you are buying at the super markets. Yes it is a little more expensive but it is worth getting organic healthy foods. ,25
79,"The best option is to go organic as it uses less pesticides,  no chemicals, and maintains biodiversity",25
173,I would say natural organic farming is a lot better. Even though it's a lot of labor it is better for the environment and for your self ,25
71,I would tell my friends to purchase organic produce because in the end this is the more natural way to go and i could lead to a healthier life style. I would not want to encourage the factory farms because i do not agree with the way they handle the animals  ,20
13,"I would say organic foods are the best option. This is because of the dangerous chemicals that they use to increase the growth rate and yield of the crops. even though they cost more, it is worth it in the end",25
215,"I would tell my friends that we should try to buy more organic foods. Although it is more expensive, it is better to not eat as many chemicals and pesticides.",25
140,"Buying and eating organically grown foods is always better; it is better for the environment and it is better for your body. However, I understand that eating organic is not always best for your wallet. My argument to a friend would be to convince them to eat organically WHENEVER POSSIBLE. It doesn't have to be every meal of every day, because you would be spending 10x more money on food, and that is not financially sustainable for every individual. However, the benefits are huge for eating organically grown foods at least a couple times per week. You will be eating cleaner foods, wasting less, and helping to promoting a more sustainable agriculture system.",30
167,"Personally I would tell my friends that nonorganic is the best option. I don't believe that the chemicals make all that detrimental of an effect on out health and nonorganic is significantly cheaper. Keeping in mind that we are all in college, if all our parents never ate organic food and are still fine now, hopefully we will too. Also, organic farming can't sustain the world. Regular farming can't sustain it either, but there's at least a greater, faster, and more consistent output of food.",25
199,I would choose organic farming over non organic because its more sustainable and better for the long run.,15
113,"I would say if you can afford to eat organic, then you should.",0
35,Organic because it can be better for the environment,15
47,"Organic, although it is more expensive it is better for the enviroment and better for your body",25
72,To go meatless,0
132,organic because you dont want chemicals in your body,15
168,I would tell my friends eating organic food is a good option because it helps our environment. I personally do not eat all organic but I do think it could better most of us. I think its good to not effect the earth with pesticides and to not put as much preservatives in our fruits and vegetables because I think eventually we will see a difference in eating non- organic  foods rather than all organic.,25
41,the option i would tell people to do it farm inorganically because it uses far less land that ends up becoming polluted because the overuse of the land of trying to grow crops normally when they die halfway through,20
131,I would recommend organic food because of the pesticides. ,15
77,Vegetarianism is the best option. You can get all the nutrients you need without getting harmful side effects and diseases that occur with long term meat eating.,0
188,"Organic because no chemicals added, maintains biodiversity and creates more jobs. ",25
111,"What is organic farming? Biology for all. throughout the video, the message holds a strong foundation as to why the increase of human population on this planet should sort to produce more organic food and to decrease the disease that comes from the soil. For instance, the video does mention the importance of crop rotation. It says that crop rotation is used to reduce diseases building up in the soils an to strengthen the soil composition. ",0
202,"I would say eating organic foods is a better option. I believe this because when buying organic foods, there is a better chance that the fresh products being bought are not sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals to enhance them. This is not always guaranteed however, the word organic is aiming towards the goal of being all natural and fresh. ",20
104,There are pros and cons to each,0
201,"i think organic still, just because it seems to be still the healthier option. ",15
10,I would say conventional because being able to produce enough food for the growing population is more important than the potential plusses of having an increase in bio importance and the environemnt around the crops. Also the increase in climate change due to cow methan produciton and shipping the organic foods around the world negate the positive climte impacts from organic growing. ,20
99,"I would tell my friends to chose organic farming. Although it is harder to keep up with, it can still be healthier than regular farming because of levels of pesticides. ",20
145,Organic farming is the better because this process does not contains chemicals or other added supplements to the foods we are eating. ,20
33,"I think i would tell my friend that we should look into a new way to do organic foods. If droughts are already becoming a problem, we shouldnt add to the lack of water.",0
106,"I would explain that based on healthy options organic foods will be better. They have less chemicals and that buying them could help local farms. However, I would also explain that the world will not be able to survive on organic farming alone. If we continue to try to push more towards that the worlds population could soon not have an adequate amount of food. Therefore we need to look to industries to supply adequate amounts of food for the worlds growing population. ",25
65,"I believe that organic farming may be something we want to achieve, it is very hard to obtain and keep up with. For example, the less pesticides we use the less crops we get and therefore we can not keep up with the growing population of 7.5 billion. Parts of organic farming should tried to be used, but cutting out pesticides completely would be unrealistic. ",0
40,if they can buy organic products then buy it but food is food so be grateful,0
82,I would tell my friends to eat conventional food because it is less expensive and I do not see a that great of an advantage to eat organic food,15
80,"I can't say I would want to try to sway my friends' thinking one way or another, honestly the best option might be for each of us to purchase the groceries that we want to eat. ",0
186,"I would tell my friends that organic foods are better. They have no harmful chemicals, and are better for the environment. They create better environments for animal life, and results in more jobs. Organic foods also use manure which is better for the land in comparison to chemicals. ",25
48,Organic because it is made naturally and nothing manufactured is added.  ,15
109,"I would tell them that the person buying organic food should be allowed to make that choice, but should instead buy their own groceries and keep their food to themselves to prevent housemates for under/overpaying.",0
221,"I would say organic is the best option because it's healthier for us. Although organic farmers can still use pesticides, they use less of them.",20
214,"conventional is not any worse for environment than organic. both have pros and cons and if less money, buy conventional.",5
55,"I would advise my friends to eat organically, because the health benefits of eating from an organic diet are far greater than eating with a conventional diet.",15
57,I would tell my friends that the best option is to eat organic food because it is better for the environment and better for their health.,20
164,Conventional food is the best option because it is cheaper and maintains biodiversity,20
3,"I wouldn't tell my friends that one is better than the other, I would just inform them about each and the pros/cons that coincide with both sides. So, based on that, I would focus more on the pros that organic faming and eating has. I think a big aspect that attracts organic consumers is the fact there are no chemical and less pesticides used while farming. It is also understandable that the cost factor may limit consumers to choose certain products, but due to the way that organic farmers produce, upkeep and maintain their food, I can see why organic prices would be higher.",5
171,eat meat because it is a good source of protein,0
38,"I would recommend they stay conventional, regardless of the video. I don't agree with going organic.",10
58,"I think that organic is the best option due to the fact that it is much healthier for your body. The pesticides on foods are generally not good for human health and although organic may be more expensive, it is better in terms of our long term health. ",25
91,Conventional farming because I believe it would be very difficult and expensive to supply a whole population with organic foods.  Also there are some environmental problems also present in organic farming.,20
4,I think it really depends on what products they are buying. in some instances buying organic makes better sense and others it does not.,5
217,"I think that the best option is to have industrial farming because not only is it cheaper but there are so many negatives to organic farming. There is more methane gas which is terrible for global warming, Its more expensive, and there is lesser yield. If there is lesser yield than you would have to produce way more than you would have to if you were industrial farming. More organic farming, more methane gas.",25
121,"I would urge people to choose conventionally grown foods. While organic foods have their benefits, the added costs don't outweigh these benefits--especially when looking at an environmental impact. In reality, we either need to improve organic or conventional farming methods so they're benefiting society and the planet at the same time.",25
203,I would say that organic is a better option. It is better for the food that you are eating and does help the earth in some ways.,20
228,I would probably tell them to make organic choices when they can but to keep in mind that organic is more expensive and I would inform them of the pros and cons.,15

181,I would tell my friends to simply stop splitting the food bill and buy and use only what they want to. ,0
27,"As much as I lean toward the organic side, the right decision for this case is to stick with the conventional food. All college students are tight on money so buying only organic food can get very expensive.

9,"I would tell my friends that although it is more expensive, organic is the way to go. It is healthier with no chemicals and less pesticides",30
117,"I would have to recommend conventional farming to my friends. As much as organic methods sound great in theory, the science behind the actual benefits aren't concrete enough for me to be able to recommend it to others. Along with that, the practicality of conventional farming to feed Earth's increasing population is a factor that can't be denied.",15
204,I would not say one is better than the other. I think she should buy some foods organic and some not just to have a good balance. ,5
192,If you purchase organic food it lowers the chances of the product containing any harmful chemicals for humans. So in that case I would say it is best as it lowers the chances of you catching any health changing chemicals instead of non-organic foods.  ,20

70,"I would tell my friends that the conventional farming is better as even though it pollutes the air, for any college student the less expensive it is the more of a bargain it is considered and the more money the college student population is willing to spend on less expensive food.

102,I would tell a friend eating organic is the best option because it is better for your body as well as the health of the planet. ,20
43,"The conventional farming technique seems to be a better choice than organic. Organic farming tends to require more land usage and more water. This leaves a negative impact on our planet. It is also said that cows burp more methane when wandering on organic farms than conventional. This increases our planets global warming issue. Even with the pros and cons of organic versus conventional farming, I would lean towards telling people conventional farming is more realistic. ",30
18,I would tell my friends that it is best to buy from organic foods because they have less cancer casing pestisides,15

56,"I believe that organic farming is better. It seems as though it is better for the environment and better for the produce. Using none, or less, pesticides is definitely a better choice than over using them. There are some issues though with organic farming. Organic farming does not seem very practical. It restricts farmers from being able to grown in large masses. With a growing population and a higher need of produce, it seems almost illogical and unrealistic to organically farm even though it may be healthier. ",30
24,"I would tell my friends that buying organic foods is the better choice.  Although the organic foods are more expensive, there are less pesticides added to the plants and it maintains biodiversity.  Organic foods ensure a healthier environment and population.  ",30

1,"From what I have heard, I feel that organic food would be the better choice. Considering that they are locally grown and they are better dealt with, organic foods seem like the better choice in my opinion. ",10
122,I would tell my friends that the best option is to cut down on using our resources like we have an unlimited supply. We don't have enough resources in the world for every person in the world so we must be responsible when it comes to our Earth and not take it for granted. ,0

By keeping it preserved longer, we make it easier for generations to come to keep up with all the work that our generation can do to preserve and conserve resources on the planet.  The main reason that people don't buy organic foods is because they are more expensive, however after more and more people start to buy organic foods, the prices should drop, and putting the money towards that is much better than putting it towards large companies and farms that use chemical substances constantly, wasting the planet's resources.",30

112,"Based on what I heard in the two videos, I would tell my friends that there are just as many pro and cons between conventional and organic farming. It's difficult to choose which is the better option because of this. If there were a more reliable source explaining each and every pro and con of them both, then it would be easier to choose. But in all honesty, almost every source that speaks of this topic is very biased. There are also no nutrient differences between the two, therefore I would tell my friends that the decision of which is better is to their own discretion. ",5
151,"Although I agree with organic being the better choice for the environment, I would say conventional because money is tight during college and we need money for books and classes more than organic food",20

153,"Conventional farming would be the better option, as it uses land  and water much more efficiently and its yields are large enough to sustain our massive population. ",25
73,"Organic because it's more closely cared for, no additives, preservatives, or large amount of pesticides are used on the crops. It also allows for my job and puts our economy back into a sustainable state. Creating more jobs in the fields will shift the views on stratification like it used to be before the industrial revolution. I think its best if people were encouraged or even forced to  go hunt and gather for resources rather than buying them from a grocery store. I feel this way because than the human race would see the value of animals and natural resources in a new view point. In addition, it would change our amount of waste and social views. We would become less dependent on foreign trade and ultimately shift back to sustaining ourselves rather than being a power hungry economy. I think our society has lost its views on what's actually important in this world and now we are consumed by an unrealistic image of how we should look, act, maintain, perform and even grew to. I may be among the few left in this world that finds farming and nature to be beautiful and a way we should all live so that we appreciate the world around us and what its natural beauty has to offer.

114,"I would tell my friends to buy non-organic. At first, I thought it would be better to buy organic foods, but there are many cons. As stated in the video, organic farming uses up more resources (water, land, etc.) compared to regular farming, which can make these resources scare. ",20
198,"I would say go with your gut, maybe try to buy locally from a farmer's market a few times a month, but ultimately organic costs more and that sometimes isn't sustainable for college students.

Factors like: How far did the food travel to get to them? What products where used on the food? Is the food local?

Even though organic farming minimizes chemical usage by using natural farming methods, improves soil health and promotes biodiversity, it is more expensive and a smaller crop yield is produced. Conventional farming practices utilize chemicals and pesticides to maintain weed and pest control. They also as use GMOs to produce a mass crop yield of produce that has been modified to improve nutrient value, taste, and texture. Conventional farming has worked for many years and seems like the best solution to provide produce for the world's growing population. ",30

34,"I would tell my friends that organic farming might sound appealing at first, but in truth, it is a luxury we as a planet can't afford right now. It is proven that organic farming reacquires a lot more water than regular farming methods utilize. For example, organic milk will take up 80% more land. As stated before, organic products take more water and as droughts become more regular today, it is a resource that we can't waste. Furthermore, organic farming also it makes it difficult for farmers to keep control of the mineral content in the soil because manure is used (pungent odor). If someone was to farm organically, that would mean having to weed crops by hand one at a time. It's not only time consuming, but labor intensive. It said that the food produced by organic farmers is ‰ÛÏa healthier product‰Û, but organic is just another word for expensive. In conclusion, the main question here is, does organic farming have the power to sustain a population of 7.5 billion? The answer is no. Hence, organic farming is not the perfect solution.

38,"Organic farming is healthier! it it the better option- you feel more at peace knowing your food is made in a natural way. For example, not many people know the exact list of pesticides being used during the farming process, and these could be toxic to our bodies. ",15
39,Eating organic is the best choice because it is pure.,15
40,"i would tell my friends about weeding. Even though it requires the most labor, this allows people to have jobs. It also doesn't involve chemicals. I feel like it has the most positive outcomes. ",15
41,"I would say that because both can have damaging effects on the environment, we should try and use some organic practices in conventional farming.",10
42,"Organic food production is a sustainable and environmentally friendly option. When consuming organic foods, we can be assured that in production there was no use of fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones. Instead, methods are used such as biological pest management, composting, manure applications, and crop rotations. These methods also promote the use of a sustainable agriculture system to provide a secure living farm for families, maintain the natural environment and resources, support the rural community, and offer fair fair treatment and respect to those involved. Other benefits of consuming organic foods include possibly higher nutritional benefits such as more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These foods are not necessarily healthier than non organic foods, however they may provide added health benefits and provide a more environmentally and socioeconomically friendly alternative for food production.",30
43,I think organic is the best since if you want to live long and naturally than organic is the best,10

45,"Conventional foods seem to be the more ideal way to eat. Although they are still using pesticides and other harmful chemicals, organic foods do to. They just use a lower dosage or different types of chemicals. You can even say they have loop-hole. Organic foods aren't keeping up with the demanding growth in population, and they are also creating more methane distribution. On top of that they are required to use more land and more water for smaller amounts of portions. Is it even worth the damage to go organic? Is it even considered organic if they are still using chemicals in the food? ",30

If we were to make more room for organic farms, we would have to cut down rain forests or something along the lines, which is environmentally bad.  ",30
54,Organic farming is probably better than the two because it is better for consumers even though it is more expensive. ,20
55,"Based on the information in the video, I would encourage my friends to eat more non-organic food, because while organic foods are theoretically better for the environment and our bodies, it still has negative environmental affects, such as its need for more land, which can lead to deforestation. Also, organic foods can still contain pesticides, which pretty much defeat the purpose of being organic. ",30
56,"I would tell people that organic farming is the best because it is healthier for the earth, but also produces healthier food since there are no pesticides.

",20
57,"The best option is not going through organic farming. I feel this way because yes it is a good idea in theory but it cannot possibly sustain the 7.5 billion people on this earth because it requires too much land for not much product. For instance, the video was saying that organic milk requires 80% more land than regular milk and there is not nearly as much. ",15
58,conventional farming is less expensive and it wont cause drought and an excess of methane gas,25
59,In my opinion conventional farming because based on the videos you pay more for organic foods when really their farming process is only slightly better than conventional farmed foods.,15
60,I will personally eat organic and I will tell my friends too because it is more natural and safer.,10
61,Being organic is always the best option. Better for humans and better for the environment. ,15
62,Conventional farming is better than organic because it is more affordable and both organic and conventional use pesticides so there is not too much of a difference. If all farms were organic there would not be enough product to support the population due to the fact that organic farming uses more land therefore conventional farming is necessary. Scientists are also still debating whether or not organic is healthier for you therefore as of right now there is no proof that organic is healthier than conventional. ,25
63,"Although hearing the word ""organic"" makes a lot of people want to turn to eating all organic, I would tell my friends that the better option is not to eat organic. Although there may be added preservatives and pesticides, the food that is being sold is still safe. Creating an all organic farms presents more greenhouse gases from the methane produced from the cows, and uses a lot more water supply than non organic foods. Although they both have their pros and cons, I would say that eating non organic is definitely not a bad thing, and would help little by little save our environment.",20
64,I think the mix of conventional and organic farming is the best. It will help use as little land as possible while still protecting biodiversity and soil composition.,15
65,Organic because it is healthier.,15
66,I would tell a friend that organic farming is the best option because it is more sustainable. Organic farming does not use pesticides and is natural. The only issue is that farmers do not know what nutrients are in some compost and manure and how these nutrients will benefit their crops. Organic farming is less harmful for the environment because chemicals are not used.,25
67,"based on the videos i wold tell my friends that although it is more expensive, in the long run, eating organically is a good choice.",15
68,Organic would be the best choice because it's better for you as foods are grown without the antibiotics and pesticides.,20
69,I like the idea of organic farms because they produce a lot of jobs due to weeding and appear to be great for the environment. ,20
70,"Although it seems there are more cons than pros in organic farming, I would tell my friend that it is still the best option for our environment. It is a lot of hard work and labor, but ideas can be exchanged and projects can be made in order to make it less of a struggle. I believe that if more individuals were educated on it, more possibilities and alternatives can me formed. Organic farming helps our biodiversity, environment, and makes products that are healthier. In my opinion, that outweighs the cons. ",25
71,"Conventional farming is the best option because there is no proven evidence that organic foods are better for you. Also, the population is high, therefore more food must be made to feed the consistently growing population. Conventional farming takes 80% less water and less land to grow the same amount of organic food. ",20
72,The best option is be an open minded thinker.,0

74,"I think non-organic foods are the best option because as mentioned in the video, the sustainable population of the world is 2 billion, and right now the worlds population in 7.5 billion. Non-organic farming yields more crops than organic farming, which only uses about 1% of all land on the planet. I believe non-organic farming is a better way to feed the worlds population, although it may be a little less healthy. I do agree with the fact that organic farming uses limited pesticides and other chemicals, however, because it uses less chemicals, the yield is less which does not feed as many people. The goal of farming is to produce foods that can be used to feed large populations so, I believe it is smarter to use the method that produces more food than the method that produces ""better"" food.

Organic farms are made to look healthier and all natural, when in reality they are allowed to use pesticides as well as conventional farms. Some organic farms even allow more chemicals than a conventional farm.

136,I would tell my friends organic is the best choice but I personally would not pick it.,10

To create organic foods, there has to separate farms to care for animals like the cows who produce more waste for the environment. Buying organic does not help the environment. ",25
147,I would tell that organic is a better option in the long run. Organic food are locally grown from a reliable source where as grocery store food is sent to a factory to be sprayed with chemicals to add a better taste.

177,I would say that organic is the way to go. I say this because it is better for the environment because there are no chemicals used and pesticides aren't being used. Also organic farming promotes a sustainable environment. Organic farming reduces pollution as well. ,25
178,I would tell them to pick organic foods.The main reason I would tell them this is because of the harmful synthetic fertilizers that are used. If one is to be exposed to the fertilizer it can be reflected on their health negatively.,15
179,"I would say that Organic is the best option for one's personal health, due to the smaller amount of chemicals used in the foods and the more local farms. However it is not attainable for whole populations due to the amount of resources it uses that are already running low. ",25
180,One of the biggest problems currently is global warming. Conventional farming adds to this problem because it uses a lot more pesticides and tries to produce more goods faster.

Organic products are more expensive and yields less.  There is less control of minerals in soil, plus the fertilizer smells bad.  Also there are more insects due to less pesticides.  ",25

187,I believe that organic farming is the best option because although it requires more work it is way more healthy for people as well as the environment. The fruit and vegetables have no pesticides on them which increase the amount of bees in the area which is good. Also using cow Manure instead of chemicals is more natural and makes the product better. ,30
188,I would tell my friends to choose the organic methods. I feel the benefits gained from not eating foods with pesticides in them out way the few negative environmental factors organic farming has. Organic farming is the way the world works naturally without human intervention.,20

195,"I would tell the that organic farming is the best option because organic farming doesn't use chemical fertilizers, helps with water and soil conservation, and has high nutritional values.  ",25
196,"I would tell my friends that the non organic food is the best option. As the video explained, most non organic farmers are using most of the same organic chemicals that organic farmers are using they are just using the bare minimum of the other non organic chemicals to increase production and sustain their yields, meaning most of the non organic food isn't actually that bad for you for a way cheaper price. Also the organic farming is bad for the environment, and with the increase of released methane can also contribute to the increased rate of greenhouse gases which is even worse for us in the long run.",25

203,"I would tell my friend that the best option is, non organic food because although we assume organic food to always be better for us, there are many cons that come along with it. To begin, the yields from organic farming are far less than that of non organic, which than makes the price of organic food much more expensive. Also, organic dairy farm produce a lot more methane than non organic farms because of the diet of the cows. The cows waste products are detrimental to our environment. Lastly, farmers have less control of the minerals that are put into soil , and with this, there are more insects and bees that swarm the produce. ",25

210,I think going vegetarian is the best option. It harms the Earth less,0
211,"I would have to read more about it because I alway assumed organic farming was the best option, I do not know enough about organic farming. For instance I did not know different countries had different organic labels and that organic farming in some cases even contributes to global warming even though it increases biodiversity.  ",10
212,I would use organic farming because it doesn't use chemicals on our fresh fruits and vegetables which is healthier for humans. it also provides more jobs due to the work that has to be done to make it organic. ,20
213,"Conventional farming is the best option in the world we currently live in because if only organic farms were used fewer people would be able to be fed. Although organic farming is clearly the more health conscientious option, it is not reasonable to be able to sustain the number of people living on Earth today.",20
214,"After watching both videos, I can confidently say that organic and conventional farming both have their fair share of pros and cons. I think itâ€™s paramount that a balance is found. While organic farming may seem like the more environmentally friendly option, it produces a lower yield. If organic farming (which currently only makes up about 1% of farming in the world) were to replace conventional farming, a significantly larger amount of land would be required. I recognize that in todayâ€™s world, quantity often prevails over quality. In our fast-paced society, people love convenience. We are constantly looking to make things as efficient as possible. Our population has never been higher, and will only continue to grow. With that said it, it only makes sense that yield is one of the most important factors of modern farming. While globalizing organic farming is probably not a very realistic option, I certainly believe that organic farming should be a global influence. This means maintaining high levels of biodiversity and soil health. I am aware of the animal abuse that is commonplace in conventional farming. This treatment is appalling, unacceptable, and inhumane. I personally believe that treating animals with dignity and respect should be prioritized. If removing animals from dark, confined and unsanitary sheds damage yield, then so be it. While it can be easy to get up in the quest for ultimate efficiency, we canâ€™t forget about the moral/ ethical responsibilities we have as humans. To summarize, I think the most realistic option would be to continue on with conventional farming as the most dominant form of farming in the world. However, I in no way believe that the current state of conventional farming is the best it could be. Thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement for the current treatment of the environment/ animals. Methods of sustainability need to become more widespread- not only in farming, but in all realms of this world.

219,"Based on watching these two videos on organic farming, I would tell my friend that organic farming is by far the best way.  I believe this because organic farming is more than just getting rid of pesticides and hormones, taking care of each animal in the way that they properly need is very important.  Raising animals to be in a comfortable environment helps them grow to be healthy, which is actually better when it comes to eating meats.  These animals who are raised on organic farms are the best kinds of meat because they won't be as tough.  ",25

There are positives an negatives of both conventional and organic farming, so instead of choosing the best of two evils I think that we should do half and half. ",5

Going with the organic option, you will support non-processed agricultural products, and pesticide-free foods which is better for the environment. If you go with the non-organic option, you can still support local farms, but the foods may be more processed and not as healthy. This option is also cheaper. For me, I would still choose non-organic because you can still be a very healthy green eater without going organic.",25

Although organic sounds pretty, it ultimately is just too much of a hassle financially, physically, and economically to push for a marginal shift into growing them over conventional methods.",20
513,"I would still say that conventional farming is the best option, strictly based on the worlds population. Organic farming offers less yields because pest interfere with the farming and kill or damage more of the crops because pesticides aren't being used to fend them off. Although organic farming can be a healthier option and more environmentally friendly, it is unrealistic to mass produce crops organically because they were require 80% more land and there simply isn't enough land to do so. ",20
514,"I would say that in theory, organic farming sounds great but it may not be the best choice. I would like more research on the carbon footprint organic farming creates. Because it takes more space, it could cause more damage to the environment than intended. Like the video pointed out, forests would have to be cleared out in order to make room for more farmland. Also I would also want to know the heath benefits of eating organic products versus eating nonorganic products, and in what way did the subjects health differ. The definition of organic foods varies from country to country. Because we import a lot of products from around the world, some may be labeled organic but are not up to the US standards for organic products. ",15

516,I would say at the given time non-organic production is best otherwise we would have no way to feed the 8+ billion people in the world. That by no way means we should not look for ways to increase crop yield while also decreasing harmful things like chemicals and pesticides in the future. It's a fine balance that must be found. ,20
517,The first video over organic farming is the best option. There are so many alternative ways for 'healthy' farming techniques that do not harm the environment but are actually good for it. I do not have a lot of knowledge on farming but the video was very knowledgable about explaining all the techniques. One technique I thought was the best was weeding; it is more time consuming but it provides jobs and is good for the planet. ,20
518,"I believe that eating red meat is the best for you. These videos mainly talked about the processing of meat and the gasses from the poop and cow give off and effect the environment. However the second video was about a farmer and how he runs his farm and how he fixes the problems the first video was talking about. He uses the gasses produced by the poop from the cow and turned it into natural gas for your car. This gas is better for the environment and has the same power that regular gas has for your car. This was something i didn't know before and found it very interesting! Also, your body needs protein and the best source of protein is red meat. Red meat also has iron and  vitamin B12. B12 is a hard vitamin to obtain and red meat has an abundance of it. Also, red meat helps improve cholesterol levels and protects your heart. Red meat also contains omega-3 fatty acid which helps depression and anxiety. I believe the cons for not eating red meat are worse than the cons for eating red meat. Not eating red meat may lead to a vitamin deficiency of B12 which then leads to anemia. Another affect is that it may lead to nutritional deficiency. You will experience muscle wasting since your body does not have enough protein Your body also needs no less than 20 percent of your daily calories to come from healthy fat sources such as lean red meat. Otherwise, the risk of other dietary deficiencies will increase. Just like everything else, eating to much of anything is bad for you. If you have a controlled diet of consuming the right amount of red meat, your body will remain healthy.  ",0
519,"Moderation of products, but do not completely boycott the industry as a whole because it would also have other consequences not explained in these videos.",0
520,To choose what is best for them.,0
521,"I would tell my friends to try organic foods whenever possible. Buying organic can be expensive, but it's always good to try and eat more organic vegetables when you can. ",15
522,Organic Farms would be the best option because the way animals are treated and how it affects the environment is not that harmful.,20
523,i would tell my friends to look up the info themselves and make their own decision. ,0
524,I would tell them to try to do research on the specific company doing the organic farming to determine whether or not their practices are done in such a way that paying more for their produce is truly worth it.,5
525,"Based on what I heard in the videos, I would encourage my friends to incorporate more organic foods into their diets. It is not feasible, as college students, to completely switch to only purchasing organic foods. Also 

I do see the ways that it positively affects the environment but the pros and cons for the environment and for my personal health seem somewhat balanced. For that reason, I am neither 100% for nor against organic foods and farming.",10
526,Organic farming. It seems to be more ethically reasonable.,10
527,"I would show them the second video because it shows how it may be good to use organic food, but it comes with some cons. Which I feel would show both sides on deciding what type of food to buy.",0
528,"I would recommend my friends to become an organic farmer over conventional farmer because it is the healthier option. Organic farming does not use any chemicals, which makes the produces healthy to consume. Also, organic farming usually use the wheating technique which makes it more effective. Overall, organic farming is the better way to go, even though it is pricier, it is still the better option when it comes to health. ",25
529,yes,0
530,I would eat clean and organic vegetables for my body and persuade my friends as well for us to be safe.,10
531,"That to me is a very hard decision. I would personally tell my friends to eat organic because it is healthier for them. The down side t a ll this though, is that if everyone in the world decided to eat organic, then there wouldn't be enough food to support that many people. ",20
532,"Organic farming. While there are cons stacked against the idea of organic farming, the results out-weigh the consequences. In both of the videos, it claims that even with organic farms using pesticides, the environment surrounding the farms are still kept in balance. There is the problem of the methane gas provided by cows being double on organic farms but if we remember the last video, the dairy farm had employed the use of a machine that recycled the methane gas into clean gas that cold be used to fuel the shipment of the produce.  ",20
533,"Organic farming seems great in theory, but the second video suggested that there are more cons to organic farming than conventional farming. So, I am not sure. I would probably say conventional farming because the cons do not seem to outweigh the pros.",10
534,I will tell my friend based on the video that organic farming is definitely the way to go and the reason behind that is because they use less chemicals in their soil which makes the food healthier for the buyer also not only is organic farming healthier for us as human beings but it was also helpful for pollution and things like that with the world.,20
535,"that they should think more about the world , and issues that effect them.",0
536,"Because of the differing opinions and how both sides are very set on their beliefs, I do not think it is reasonable to assume you can easily convince a friend to become organic. You can tell them the benefits, but based on a number of factors such a money, availability, access to the availability, health, and time, they will choose what works best for them. I myself do not eat organic things often because even though I know the benefits, it is much too pricey. As for actual farmers and producers, I think it is great that they are trying to educate the general public more and create innovative ideas to offset environmental harm. The world is never too full of incentive, and perhaps a collaboration of health consciousness and organic production will become more popularized and available in the future.",10
537,"After watching these two videos, this is a difficult question for me to answer. I believe that the best option is for us to eat foods that come from an organic farm; however, I don't believe this is the best option for our environment. I am truly torn on which is the best option considering the pros and cons to both, but if I have to answer I would tell my friends that conventional farming is the better option as a whole. ",15
538,I feel that option 1 is the best choice. This is because it is the most environmentally friendly option overall.,15
539,"I feel as if both have their pros and cons, organic farming allows for things to be recycled but also is much harder to control certain variables, regular farming has no smell, more controllable, and you know how many minerals something is receiving. I feel as if regular framing is better ",15
540,"I would tell my friends to eat whatever they want. Everyone is different and most of my friends always tell me ""I do what I want"" despite logical reasoning.",0
541,"I would tell them that eating organic is definitely a great alternative. But, when it comes down to it both organic and conventional farming have effects on the environment. Organic farming seems to be the best choice, but it is very expensive. Until resources are available to be able to supply organic farming as the sole farming way to feed billions of people, then conventional farming shouldn't necessarily be look at as a completely negative alternative. ",20
542,"It honestly depends. It depends from what perspective you are looking at the problem from. Which choice would be better from the perspective of feeding all the world population? From this particular standpoint, the best option would be to stick with conventional farming. Organic farming does not yield enough to feed our growing population. If we can figure out a way to increase our yield using organic farming methods, that would be the best option. The other perspective is from the environmental/health perspective. Which is the best option for the environment and our health? Organic farming methods limit the amount of additives and pesticides they use on their crops. And we know this is a huge plus for our environment and health in general. Decreases the chances of pesticides having a long-term impact on our bodies. ",25
543,Organic foods are the best option for your body,10
544,"For me, organic farming is still my choice. Mostly because for us consumers, it is healthier. With that being said, you waste more food then regular farming because you don't use as much chemical sprays to keep insects off of it. ",20
545,I would tell them that the best option for them is to watch the videos themselves to form their own opinions of the topic of organic vs non-organic food. ,0
546,"i wouldn't tell him, so he would have to decide for himself",0
547,"Choose organic when you can because it is better for the environment, but always choose vegan food because it is better for the environment, your health, and the animals.",15
548,"As a passionate environmentalist, I would choose organic farming.",10
549,To think fully about each decision.,0
550,"I would say that even though organic is a great option, not many people can afford that option; therefore, I would say to eat a clean diet meaning that they would still be eating mostly fruits and vegetables but does not require them to purchase all organic products.",15
551,"Going organic is a waste of time, eat anything and everything.",0
552,Already previously explain in pre-survey.,0
553,"I would tell my friends it is better to eat food that is raised organically, because it avoids using harmful pesticides and unnatural growth hormones. ",20
554,"Nonorganic seems as though it is the best option to sustain the environment and a number of people in the world. It seems that going organic has more cons than pros, as it is causing greenhouse gases, taking up more land, and causing more drought. ",20
555,I feel organic crop farming is still the best option because it is better for the environment and creates jobs. More regulation on pesticides needs to occur though. I feel non organic animal farming is okay as long as it is regulated. Animals should not be fed antibiotics and their waste needs to be converted into energy.,25
556,To eat as organic as possible and mostly fresh fruit and vegetables. When we eat meat its harder for our bodies to digest and processed foods are hard as well.,10
557,I'm still undecided ,0
558,"I would tell my friends to go with organic farming because it is going to be beneficial in the years to come. Although it is more tideous for the farmers, they can make more profit to produce more of it. ",10
559,"I would explain to my friends exactly what organic farming is before making them pick and choose. Organic Farming is indeed this type of farming that's suppose to be good for the environment but like anything else in the world it has it's pros and cons. I would list the pros and cons and typically weigh each option hand and hand to see which one is less harmful and more beneficial for a greater cause. Everything organic isn't all good. Organic products indeed are luxuries that the world can't afford as a whole. Although, organic farming is a natural alternative it simply causes problems that lead up to global warming issues. So with everything being said I'd evaluate the best option in the situation in this sense picking the side against organic farming because although its a great alternative it also causes problematic issues for the environment. ",15
560,"Organic food is no doubt the healthier more beneficial food type to choose but from personal experience i would say non organic would be the tastier food choice, and has the ability to be somewhat healthy for you.  ",15
561,"Organic farming is a very healthy and preferable alternative than modern conventional farming methods. However, with the population of Earth increasing exponentially, options to feed a mass population are needed in order to ensure survival. Extensive research has been conducted  into the health effects of pesticides and the FDA and US Department of Agriculture have concluded that the foods produced using conventional pesticides are safe for human consumption. The best choice is modern farming techniques for its capability to feed the ever growing worldwide population, whereas organically grown crops are insufficient in quantity to provide apt nourishment for humanity.",15
562,"I would tell them to not be fooled by organic labels, and to remember that different countries have different standards for being ""organic."" In my opinion, I think that you're just wasting more money by buying organic stuff and that not all things that aren't organic are bad.",15
563,"I would tell my friends that while conventional farming is better for the population and sustaining food production for the upcoming years, organic farming has better results of living which can eliminate so many obstacles we face today such as illnesses from conventional pesticides, food poisoning, and other toxicity issues we encounter in America.",25
564,"Before these videos I didn't understand how toxic cow waste was to our environment. Especially saying how prominent beef is in the United States and there are cows everywhere. I would tell my friend the best option would be to try and go vegan for one meal out of the week, because one person wouldn't make a difference necessciarily but if more were to join it would go a lot better.",0
565,"There isn't a better option. They are both reasonable and being debated still for a good reason. When there's a ratio of pro's and con's for both and just as equally good/bad. I am undecided on the topic of organic vs. non-organic. Similarly, scientists can't decided one side or another because while organic food can be good, it can also be bad and lead to worse events. For example, there's more unhealthy gases in the air from organic cows than regular. ",5
566,organic foods and farming are better for the environment but in a world with a population steadily growing more than it can provide it would be best to stick with conventional foods because it gets the job done fast and easier.,20
567,"I think conventional farming is the best option because it produces high yields to sustain our population. Also, organic farming has many negative byproducts such as needing more land and water which we simply do not have because those are scarce resources. By acquiring more land it would damage the environment even more so that defeats the purpose of organic being healthy and good for everyone. Also cows produce twice as much methane gas on organic farms than on conventional farms so while trying to reduce the environmental footprint I feel like it is too late and we have already caused too much damage. Therefore, I believe we should stick with what is working which is conventional farming.",30
568,The superior option is definitely sustainable farming in my opinion.  It maximizes the product created by cows while minimizing harmful environmental effects.  It would help reduce the damage caused by the meat industry.,0
569,"Based on what I viewed, I believe that organic farming is still a better option because you're not using any chemicals and farmers have to find natural ways to produce our food. It is better for the environment even though you're generating small yields. ",25
570,I would tell them that Organic farming is the best option if it's for a controlled environment. I say this because it would take to slow and we would not get as much yield as we would if we grew it biochemically. ,15
571,I would tell them that organic is the way to go until more scientific research occurs on how it could be worse than conventional farming. ,10
572,"organic farming is better because of it healthy for you. Yes, some might cost a lot to buy food but it worth it because of it good for your health and you might live longer.",20
573,"Organic farming is what I would choose, because we only have one earth. Industrial farming is done simply because it's easy and convenient. If we put the same amount of time and energy into learning how to improve organic farming as we do with industrial farming, we'd have new convenient easy ways to farm while also helping the environment. Yes, it yields less, there's pesticides, it's harder to do, etc. But we could use the technology we have now to fix these problems. ",20
574,"I would tell my friends about the second video because it goes in depth about how organic farming isn't necessarily as clean and healthy as everybody thinks it is, it is actually harmful in ways.",15
575,"I think there needs to be a health medium between both conventional and and natural farming. I do believe some natural farming should be keep for the some individuals for society willing to pay for it. However, natural farming needs to have more limitations on the amount of land used. I also believe conventional farming should still be able to use pesticides but needs to have strict boundaries.   ",15
576,"Though I am completely for helping the environment, I am also a realist and with that being said I would advise my friends the best choice would be inorganic foods. As was stated in the video, to have organic farming would require a mass amount of water and land that would not be possible to obtain. Organic farms also require a lot of work from farmers themselves because although some chemicals can be used they rarely are. Pesticides get into the plants causing farmers to have to start over many times. All in all, organic seems like a great idea but realistically it would not happen. ",25
577,Organic. You lose the risk of developing diseases derived by GMOs and it is a more natural process.,15
578,"i would tell my friends that the best option would be organically grown foods, not only are the animals not give antibiotics, it also reduces the amount of pollution and is overall better for us in the long haul. ",20
579,"I'd say to purchase products from conventional farming as there is not enough evidence that says organic is healthier or safer for the environment. There are pros and cons that were discussed in the video, but not enough to convince me to go organic. Although organic farms only take 1% of the land, if they continue to grow there will have to be deforestation which I strongly oppose and to me that's already not worth buying produce that although it has fewer pesticides hasn't been proven to be healthier. ",15
580,I would tell my friends to purchase organic foods because there is a better chance of having less chemicals in them.,15
581,"Based on the videos, I would tell my friends to choose the conventional farming method because not only is it cheaper with a higher yield rate for food production, but the same if not less amounts of methane gas is released into the ozone layer, which can slow down the process of climate change. Also, Conventional farming and organic farming processes can both use insecticides and gmo's which is the reason people switch to organic in the first place, but organic produce can have small amounts of these chemicals in them too. ",30
582,I would tell my friends it is up to them. Either if they care more about their body or about the earth and how much money they would like to spend on the healthier choice. Of course there are some downsides with organic but there is always down sides to every produce on the market. ,0
583,"Organic farming is the better alternative to commercial farming in theory, but commercial farming uses less resources and yields more and is the better option.",20
584,"I would tell them that it is best if they were to go organic if they still wanted to eat meat simply for the fact that the producers are trying to keep up with the need of meat and it is causing them to inject the animals with a chemical that is bad for you to eat and it can cause damage to your body without you even knowing overtime. It is best to cut out meat in general but, if you just have to have it make sure that it is completely natural. ",15
585,To me there is a good and bad to everything so I would just tell them what I think is the best option and let them choose for themselves. ,0
586,I like the organic farming because it brings high nutrition values and improved human health.,15
587,"I think that a good mix between industrial style and organic style farming is a simple mix of the two. Obviously, it would he extremely harmful to the environment to purely stick to one style. Rather, we should incorporate a little bit of both for a more solid and non-destructive resolution.",5
588,organic farming is the best option because it is better for the environment and the people,15
589,I would say that organic farming is best because we can control what goes into our food without harmful chemicals.,15
590,"I think organic farming is the best option, because it utilizes all the materials and resources while minimizing the amount of toxins and pollution as a result. ",20
591,"I would tell my friends that organic farming is still the best option because when you take a closer look at each farming technique, conventional farming has far more cons than does organic farming. Yes, organic farming may produce more methane and yield lower crop yields, but conventional farming will require more land use causing us to tear down more of our forest which can, in turn, be  more detrimental to our environment. ",25
592,Organic farming does not seem a practical choice for the world today. The crop yields are much too low and require too many natural resources. I suggest making conventional farming more green rather than using organic farming. ,15
593,I would tell my friends the second video is the best choice because it takes into account the cons of organic farming and if it really could sustain our growing population.,15
594,"I think that despite the fact that there is less of a yield with organic farming compared to conventional methods, I think that organic is still that way to go because there are less chemicals used which means the long term effect on the body that could lead to extended life, we should be focused on what we are putting in our bodies as we are what we eat.  ",20
595,"I would say organic farming is a better option than conventional farming because there are no pesticides, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics, or additives. There is also less harm done to the environment, which is important with so many issues with the planet as it is.",25
596,The video suggest that organic eating is so much better for you body because their arent any pesticides  that may be harmful to your health in the future. Also we dont really know if things that are GMO are actually harmful to humans yet because its such a new sciance,15
597,I would choose organic farming because it eliminates the need for pesticides.,15
598,i would tell them that eating healthy is the most important step you're going to take in your lifetime. the video did an excellent job of detailing those out ,0
599,"I don't think organic farming is viable in this day and age. Like the narrator mentioned, many people like organic food because they believe that it is better. It stood out to me that the narrator said believe instead of saying that it is better for you. While people were able to sustain themselves with organic farming prior to the industrial revolution, that was only because there were so much fewer people. The maximum capacity that an environment can have eventually levels out, but, with humans, technological advances allow us to grow beyond our habitat's natural max capacity. Just because organic farming is how it used to be done and can be seen as more pure than farming today, doesn't mean that it is better. Technology advances the way it does to help humanity; going backwards won't often yield better results.",20
600,I would recommend the organic way because it provides us with the best resources when it comes to pertaining to the body . It as well help the world in a more helpful manner instead of all the chemicals beginning to be put into our foods now. Its more of a health way of eating and saving the planet. ,20
601,"Non organic farming, greenhouse gases are a problem and the fact that it produces more beats the idea of it. The fact that more land needs to be used is a problem as well, because many forests are already being cut down for conventional farming and the world can't afford to get rid of more",20

Sure, it is cheaper to eat conventional food, but if they can feel free to pay the up-charge for organic foods.",5
724,I would say no organic. I would rather be able to feed more people rather than having to find more land to create the same amount of food. ,20
725,"The overall best option, is organic food over conventional. It is the better choice for a healthy diet, because of the nutritional value provided. Conventional food includes processed food which contains pesticides and chemicals which are not good for the body. It is more convenient for people on the run to stop by a fast food restaurant or to choose the cheaper product, but with most things the cheaper option might not be the best option. For anyone, but mostly people concerned about or interested in pursing a healthier lifestyle choosing to go organic, is a great option. ",25

763,"I would tell them that organic food is a much safer alternative. But I also believe that not all organic food is of better quality, so being we are all students on a budget, I would honestly recommend for a majority of their food to be non organic.",20
764,"I would tell my friends to choose whatever they felt comfortable with, although eating organically seems to be better in a lot of ways. There are also good things about eating conventionally. I would tell them to weigh their options before they made their decision.",0
765,I would say the organic is the best option for them because it is not chemical induced like the machine foods are. It also maintains a diversity.,20
766,"While it may not be the most cost efficient, it has less pesticides and herbicides. This makes it healthier than conventional products. Also as the yield is low paying the little extra money can help the farmers tremendously.",25
767,I will always say organic but only buying organic foods can get expensive and sometimes hard to find. ,15
768,i would say no chemicals because i don't understand it like i think i should. ,0
769,"Conventional foods, because I know organic foods are more expensive and you have to go to a farmers market to get them. Plus most of my friends don't have the kind of money to spend on organic foods or the patients to find a farmers market to get the organic foods. ",15
770,"I would tell them to choose to go organic because it will help open up more jobs, and also because it is more safer and clean.",15
771,Organic because there are less chemicals involved,15
772,"Organic, because it is better in the long run for our health and the environment we live in. ",20
773,"organic foods because they benefit the body more. While they are more expensive, they give the body the proper natural nutrients that it needs",20
774,"I would tell my friends that the best option is to eat organic foods because they are farmed without the usage of chemicals, less pesticides and maintain biodiversity on farms. ",25
775,"If my friends ask me what is the cheaper option I will tell them conventional. If my friends ask me what is the healthier option I will tell them organic. Personally, I think the better option would be organic because the fact that it has less chemicals and hormones. But as a broke college student I will pick conventional because it's cheaper and there is a wider variety on options.",25
776,Organic because overall the benefits outweigh the conventional benefits.,10
777,"Organic, although more expensive, is the more beneficial option. It has no chemicals and will help your body in the long run ",25
778,"Organic food, because organic food honestly better for you in the long run because even if you don't feel the effects of the chemicals now you will feel the effects of those foods in the future when you are older.",15
779,The best option is to eat organic food. Eating organic food is beneficial to the body and to your health. It gives you vitamins that your body needs and helps you when you age. Organic food will be a bit more expensive but it has a better taste and a better look to it. Your body will feel healthy once you consume organic items.,20
780,"Organic foods are the best option, however, it may not always be available to everyone. I feel that as long as people eat certain foods in moderation, they can still be healthy.",10
781,"I would tell my friends that eating organic is the best choice because despite it being more expensive, there are less pesticides and chemicals in the food. ",25
782,"While watching the video I would recommend organic to friends because I feel like Organic food is a better way to maintain a healthy lifestyle  as well as diet. Consuming to many conventional food may be deteriorating to health because it uses chemical fertilizing. Also the pricing of Organic is more expensive because it takes a longer time to produce, and usually longer time means the better the end product. ",30
783,"I'd tell my friends that organic is the best option because even though it's less convenient than conventional farming, it's healthier for our Earth and our bodies. ",25
784,"If the money is available, organic is the best option. This is true because it uses lest pesticides and chemicals compared to conventional foods. With a lower use of chemicals, it is also helping our environment that is slowly worsening.  ",30
785,"I feel like eating organic is better for you, but depending on their financial place in life maybe they should just keep eating the way they do. ",15
786,I would tell my friends that organic is the best option because it has no pesticides and no chemicals which is better for us. ,20
787,Organic farming,10
788,"Organic foods because they have no chemicals, less pesticides and they maintain biodiversity. ",25
789,"I would tell my friends that the conventional eater should just try out organic since we have been eating conventional for so long. We could try that for awhile, and we can even alternate meals for the conventional friend, but always have organic options. Also, tell the organic friend if that doesn't work, she will have to buy her own food and the two of us conventional eaters will have to split. Or vice versa depending if I went organic. ",0
790,"I would say organic farming, thinking about the long term effects on our environment and population.",20
791,"I would tell my friends to not go organic. Just because there are less pesticides and no chemicals, we are still broke college students that do not have the luxury of eating more expensive foods for the sake of ""healthy"" when inorganic food still provides us with the nutrients we need in order to maintain good health.",25
792,Organic foods are better because they use less pesticides and there are no chemicals,20
793,Organic because it is more healthy.,15
794,I think that my friends could make a compromise for some foods to be organic and some can still remain conventional. Items such as chips can remain conventional and fruits and veggies can be organic.,0
795,Organic; choosing organic is better for your health in many ways.,15
796,"Conventional, it is cheaper and still has good levels of nutrients 

",20
797,"Based on what I heard in the videos I would tell my friends to choose whats best for each of them because we don't know if no chemicals or less pesticides are being used on the foods we consume, and we also don't know if conventional farming is good either. So, who am I to tell my friends what to eat and what not to eat. I'll rather let them decide for themselves so if something does happen I won't be the one to blame. ",0
798,"Organic is the best choice because organic foods contain no chemicals, less pesticides and maintains biodiversity.",25
799,"I would tell my friend the best option is organic farming for the reason they use less pesticides and are said to maintain biodiversity. But I would also say there is nothing wrong with conventional farming either because its up to speed on where its needed to be at, as well as its cheaper for us. ",25
1,"The second choice definitely, as it is cleaner, and most cost-effective. ",15
2,"It would depend on why we are watching the videos. If it was for a class such as digestion or about pollution/methane production then I would chose the first video as it is more factual. If it was for self education, I would watch the second as it is a more interesting piece and not as dry. ",0
3,"I think sustainable agriculture is the best option because I think that it is more realistic. The chances of Americans decreasing their consumption of hamburgers a week is not likely especially over the summer, so many American families have barbecues like its their job. Using farming techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare is a smart and easy way to help protect the environment. ",25
5,"I would tell my friends that the best option is meatless sources. In video 2, they explained how milk, then manure to be used as fuel. Then crops are able to be grown. Its a better cycle.  ",15
7,"Personally, I would tell my friends that eating meat and consuming dairy products has a much bigger impact on the environment then they think. The video that was able to convert fertilizer to energy is extremely interesting but I still believe the overall cost of consuming animal products is wrong. I personally, don't eat meat or dairy, and have been a vegan for 2 years - so perhaps i'm biased. However, I do believe people need to start thinking about the impact their food has on their bodies and the environment. ",15
8,I would tell my friends that going meatless is the best option because it's the most environmentally friendly option. It is also the option that is the least cruelty-free. ,20
9,"Based on what I heard in the videos, I would suggest to a friend to start eating green in order to help improve sustainability of our planet. ",15
10,"I would tell my friends that beef is the least of our concerns when we have billions of cars, planes, factories, dumps and ect killing the planet",0
11,I would tell my friends the best option is to choose organically grown foods and choose foods from local markets. ,10
12,"Based on the two videos, I would tell my friends to try eating meals with less/no beef as well as buying locally grown produce because it is healthier and benefits local businesses. ",15
13,"The first video because it talks about the dangerous effects on humans and the environment based on cow manuer, and consumption of cow for hamburger beef. I believe this is crucial to know the negative effects the farming process and food handling is taking a toll on people in terms of weight and dangerous gases brought on by the cow manuer. ",15
14,"I believe the ability to use cows as a renewable fuel source is the best option. The majority of Americans will be too reluctant to quit consuming dairy products and cow meat, so it is best to use the cow in a healthy way for the environment.  ",15
15,"I would tell my friend to eat green, because if the average american actually does eat 3 burgers a week, that is scary, especially because of that rate, we have to feed cows corn which they are not even meant to be eating. ",5
16,To try to eat meat when you don't have too or choose to only eat it once a week instead of 3. This can help the environment and lower pollution the more people do it,15
17,I would tell them to do what the felt was the best ,0
18,I would tell my friend sustainable farming is the better option.,10
19,"i believe the best choice would be to go with the sustainable energy. there will always be meat eaters. it would take a lot of hard work and dedication to switch every meat eater into vegan. but the only option that we have without hurting the environment any more than we already are is to use the resources that we already have. using the methane from cows to power trucks, making it a form of green renewable energy. ",10
20,That using the manure to create gas is better because there is less pollution going into the atmosphere. ,5
21,I would tell my friends it is better to not support the cattle industry after watching the first video because cows are becoming a leading cause of pollution to the earth which is already a major issue. ,15
22,"Changing our farms so that they reuse the manure produced by the cows is the best solution. That way, Americans can still have as much meat as they want, and the environment isn't getting hurt.",15
23,The second option because it provides an easier and clearer solution.,10
24,I'd rather maintain a balanced consumption.,0
25,The best option is to eat meat that is preferable for you. As long as you have enough evidence to support your decision you should be fine.,5
26,"I would tell my friends that protein from an animal source is fine as long as there was no added antibiotics or growth hormones because it is a good source of protein, meaning there is a lot more protein in a serving of animal then from puts or seeds.",15
27,"I would tell my friends about the farm that uses the byproducts of cattle to help cattle survive while producing milk and energy. The video was happy and shorter so naturally, the attention is drawn to that.",10
28,"I would tell my friends the best option is the sustainable farming.  Having a farm with a lot of cows causes a lot of pollution to the air from the methane.  By using this method, farmers are able to use that polluting gas and turn it into something useful like fuel to transport your goods and fertilizer to produce food for their cows.  This method will help to limit the amount of methane that gets released into the air along with helping not too heat up the earth to quickly. ",20
29,"I think that making natural gas from cow manure is a great idea to sustain energy, since we already have so many cows in the US",5
30,"I would tell my friends about both videos, but encourage them to follow the first. I think this would be the best option because this is something they would be able to start immediately and some of us already do it. ",10
31,Animal products because they still taste good and are easily obtainable.,10
32,I'd tell my friends that that sustainable farming is the better option. Because it is the more likely to happen fewer people you have to convince.,10
33,the sustainable farming would be the better option because it uses natural gas and is better for the environment.,15
34,"Out of the two videos, I would tell my friends that sustainability is the best option (video 2) because you get the same results, but it is better for the environment. The first video shows the corrupt system that we as a society have created which ultimately causes green house gas pollution. Yet with sustainable farming, the milk and manure from Fair Oaks Farm in Indiana comes together in a digester to make renewable natural gas. This allows a tanker truck to deliver this milk all through the upper Midwest. Therefore, 2 million gallons of natural gas fuel is produced using this farming technique. ",15
35,"I believe the best option would be video two because in it, they are taking something that could be harmful to the earth and making it into something green and beneficial. It is almost unrealistic to ask the whole world to stop eating meat like in the first video.",15
36, I would tell my friends to not eat meat three times a week and instead only have it once a week because of its negative effects on both the environment and on our bodies. ,20
37,"I would suggest for my friends to cut down on beef and dairy consumption all together, as it is a change i have already made in my life (i eat pork and chicken, and rarely red meat. I do not drink milk). Cutting down on a smaller scale will have big results if enough people do it, compared to farms spending millions to fix a problem that we as consumers can fix just by making a healthier dietary choice.",20
38,"Eating ""green"", and healthy protein! Protein is better if it is not processed because has less chemicals in it. I don't believe there is enough research to prove their negative long-term effects, but they are the worse of the two. ",15
39,"In my opinion the best option is to go vegan. I have been vegan for about a year now and it has been the best decision I have ever made. Not only is it ethically better, it also helps preserve our environment. The health benefits are also numerous.",25
40,sustainable farming is the most beneficial option because it saves the environment by helping with the conservation of natural resources. It also reduces the need chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It also protects health.,30
41,"I would say the best, most realistic option would be to make our farms more sustainable. However to make an impact on an individual scale, it would be best to cut down on beef consumption.",10
42,"Based on the videos, the sustainable farming techniques are much more environmentally friendly. The methods they used helped to clean the manure on the farm, while also recycling it for further use. They take more time to ensure the cows they raise will not be as large of a contribution to the greenhouse gases by recycling the manure for more beneficial uses like fertilizer and natural gases.",25
43,"I said the second video would be the best choice just caused it tell us the good side of the cows and how people use cow manure in a different but efficient way for the environment

",10
44,Cows hold much importance in the U.S. even though they produce large amounts of greenhouse gasses the use of their manure as fuel helps to reduce the amount of gas used. Cows are very versatile with their uses ranging from milk and meat production to transportation and other services.,0
45,"I would tell my friends the best option is to cut down on red meat weekly. I would advise them to limit their intake on cheese, milk, and saturated fats. The $2.00 really isn't worth it, because we are paying for it in other ways. Such as the environment, and pollution that is causes. Although, there have been making scientific breakthroughs with how we handle the maneuver from animals to prevent further damage, everything helps to make us live a better life  ",20
46,It is best to choose a moderate approach. There are many costs of the hamburger and it may be harmful to a diet but if you would like to eat in moderation it is okay.,5
47,"Eliminate beef completely from your diet, because you can easily get protien from other sources without all the negative effects.",10
48,I would tell my friends to think about the food choices that we make on the daily because they can have negative long-term effects. ,0
49,"I would tell my friends sustainable farming is the better option for many reasons. One, sustainable farming is better for the environment. It maintains soil quality which reduces soil degradation and erosion which saves water. Sustainable farming is also better for agriculture. ",25
50,"You have to pick and choose which companies you buy your meat or milk from. Cows can be harmful to the environment, but only if you support those companies that aren't farming sustainably. Yes, you can find other sources for the protein, but what happens to those companies that are benefiting the environment and are trying to take care of us?",10
51,I would tell my friends that eating meatless protein options is better because it is more environmentally friendly and the cost is less than meat sources.,20
52,To not eat caged meat.,0
53,"Based on the two videos, I would tell my friends about the cycle with the cows and how the famers recycle the wastes that is  used rather than throwing them away. They utilize what they have and give back to the environment. To me, I feel like this is the better option because rather than the unhealthy burgers that was in the first video, the second video shows how they use the milk and manure from cows to create their own gas which saves a ton of money. ",30
54,The best option would be taking all of the cow manure produced and turning it into renewable energy to power trucks and other buildings.  ,5
55,"I would tell my friends more about the first video and the harm that meat production and cattle farms have on us and the environment. While the information in the second video is a step forward for the world and the environment, not many other farms around the world are doing the same thing, making it important that we as consumers take steps to limit our meat and dairy consumption.",25
56,I think that eating local meat is best since there is less environmental impact. When you don't have to transport the animal long distances it helps to reduce carbon emissions. ,20
57,The best option is not feeding the cows the corn and feeding them more grass since they are big producers of methane gas and it is a huge factor of climate change over CO2 emissions.,20
58,try to eat less meat and dairy products ,10
59,The best option is to continue practicing farm usage like the second video and focus on recycling and educating people on this issue,10
60,I will tell them to eat meat if they please too because animals are someone else food chain and you should eat what you enjoy just in moderation.,10
61,"The best choice would be limiting the consumption of meat to help one, with the environment, and because it is healthier.",20
62,Buying protein from local farms with no added hormones ,15
63,"I would tell people to start eating less red meat and maybe limit the amount of burgers they are in taking a week. Personally, I do not eat red meat and it makes me feel good knowing that I am not contributing to this greenhouse gas effect in this way. I want others to follow my lead and realize how much we are overproducing cows and destroying our enviornment.",20
64,"The second option, because instead of trying to disassemble the beef industry it not only allows for peoples' diets to stay the same but also produces a new source of alternative energy as well.",15
65,I think the first option is the best. It seems more logical and safer.,10
66,"I would tell a friend to withstand from eating meat at least once a week because to have healthy animals like cows there are consequences. There are issues such as runoff water, fueling transportation, and pollution.",25
67,I think the best option is to cut out sugared foods and limit meat consumption,10
68,"People should cut down on the amount of meat consumed daily as well as junk food and sugar, and focus more on the healthy stuff like fruits and vegetables because it's not only bad for humans but for the environment ",20
69,Meat sources of protein just because we get better protein through animal protein,10
70,"Based on the videos, I would tell my friends that sustainable farming, as demonstrated by Fair Oaks Farms, is the best option. The filtration process they use in order to convert cow manure to gas for their vehicles prevents them from having to use diesel. Their method of recycling the methane gas that comes from cow manure is a great way to decrease that methane gas from spreading into the atmosphere. If more farms copied this technique, it can make a large impact in our environment and reduce climate change. ",20
71,I would tell my friends the best option is sustainable farming. This way the consumption of dairy and meats for cows do not have to be cut out completely. This option is less harmful to the environment.  ,15
72,The best option would be to be as informed about the topic as you can be and to make educated decisions based off of it ,0
73,sustainable farming because it is the safest for environment and human health.,20
74,"After careful consideration, I would tell my friends about sustainable farming as the best option. Throughout the video, it is seen that they put all the products being produced to good use so that there is minimal waste. They use the milk that is produced to make ice cream on the farm and also sell to manufactures. They also take the manure produced by the cows, and turn it into usable gas to fuel, trucks, planes, and the equipment on the farm as well. The leftover manure from the gas production process is put right back into the soil on the farm as fertilizer. Sustainable farming can be described as using farming techniques to preserve and protect the environment, public health, human conservation, animal welfare. This is exactly what the farm shown in the video was doing. They grow the crops from the manure, the crops are used to feed the cows, which produce milk , manure, and methane gas, which in turn go back to growing crops; in a efficient cycle of farming. This is not only good for the environment because of the minimal waste being produced, but as seen in the video, is also an entertaining place to take your family. ",30
75,"I would tell my friends that the best option is to try to limit beef consumption to once or twice a week maximum. Also, it would be important to try to consume meat products that come from farms that use renewable resources to help the environment.",15
76,"I think the best option is the second video. This is because it's looking at the positive side of things. For example, the cows are being made to make milk, and the manure is being used as a recycled product that is doing good for the environment.

",15
77,"I would say the manure being transformed into renewable gas is the best choice. I think this because this doesn't make the cow seem like the bad guy for producing so much waste, but instead make something great out of it. ",20
78,going meatless because the effect on the environment is detrimental. I would especially agree because I recently attended a Cornell forum where it was stated all the ice in the artic will be melted by 2030 if we continue at the rate we are at,15

178,The choice I would tell my friends is to cut down on the amount of red meat they consume. I would tell them this because they probably do not understand everything that is happening to the earth because the amount of red meat we eat and what we are doing with cows in general. I would tell them this to inform them and make them non ignorant because it is unlikely that they know the situation and what is happening.,15
179,I would say grass fed meat is the best option because it is healthier for us and also better for the environment as a whole.,20
180,"Based on the videos I just watched, I would tell my friends the best option is video 2 ""sustainable farming."" Cows produce methane gas which is negatively affecting the earth therefore, if Americans don't cut back on the amount of burgers and beef we eat the earth may not be able to keep up. With the sustainable farming we have the chance to put the methane to us and use it as renewable energy in hope to positively effect the planet.",20
181,"I would tell my friends that the best option to decrease the pollution is to take the manure from the cows and covert it into sustainable energy that can be used. This method helps create energy safely from the many cows that they milk. Instead of the manure being wasted, it is turned into something beneficial. ",15
182,"I would tell my friends to choose sustainability because to survive in the 21st century you're going to need sustainability , creativity, technology, innovation.  It's also a way to avoid the depletion of natural resources and all together is just healthier and better for us.",20
183,"Sustainable farming because the techniques they use protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare.",25
184,try to eat more green and organic foods and cut back on beef. this is because the way of life of cows is so harmful so our earth with all of the waste and co2 they produce,15
185,I would choose to tell them to make there own choice. Your own choice is the best and can only come back to you at the end of the day.,0
186,I think the sustainable farming is the best option. It is the best of both worlds and nothing is wasted.,15
187,I would tell my friends to cut down on beef just one day of the week because it can still have a huge impact on our environment. The cow meat is mixed with different cows which can spread diseases and also it inst right that our country kills as well as consumes the most meat. I also believe it is just morally wrong to slaughter all of those helpless cows. ,20
188,"I don't think there is a better or worse choice. The first video shows us all the damaging aspects of using the beef industries our meat protein sources but also offered easy ways to make improvements like cutting out meat and cheese from your diet just one day a week. The second video showed how farmers can use the harmful methane gas the first video talks about, and put it to good use by using it to transport the farm's milk, a good source of protein for humans.",20
189,I would tell my friends about video 2 because it explains a new technology for producing natural gas.  ,15
190,That we should not eat as much meat as we do because it is bad for the environment and is not good for our health when it is read meat like hamburgers.,20
191,To do whatever is most important to you and that would be most beneficial. Do this because it is important to prioritize your objectives in order to get things done.,0
192,Cut down intake of beef or completely cut it out of your diet because of the environmental issues it causes to produce a single hamburger. ,15
193,Eat no meat or dairy one day a week because that will greatly reduce the production of greenhouse gases.,15
194,"The second option!  The system is overall more efficient.  In the first video, it talks of all the waste of normal processes.  In the second video with sustainable farming, everything has its place, there is no waste.",20
195,"I would tell my friends who all eat meat regularly to try and do a meatless day throughout the week to start.  I would inform them about the meat market, the large amounts of resources needed, environmental problems it causes, animal cruelty, etc.  Giving them information about this topic would allow them to be aware of the cons of the meat market and maybe even limiting the amount of meat they consume.  ",25
196,"i would tell my friends the best option is reducing the amount of burgers and meat they eat. I think the little things we can do weekly has huge impacts on our health, environment and planet.",20
197,Meat is important to consume because it provides the body with essential nutrients that other food can can not provide  ,15
198,Meatless because meat has more trans fat and cholesterol than plant-based protein.,15
199,"I think that the second option is the best option. By using the manure to create a source of methane is ecofriendly. In addition, the cows are still eating crops that are good for them because it is a continuous cycle. ",20
200,"I think sustainable farming is the best option because it is farming while using good techniques that protect the environment, animal welfare and public health. It also does not compromise on future generations needs to help and meet the needs of society right now.

",25
201,Consumers should always be aware of what the food they are eating and where they are coming from. Food from a clean source without a lot of antibiotics and processing is better. ,5
202,I would encourage them to cut back on their intake of red meat and try to get protein through other foods. I would tell them about the affects that it can have on our environment.,15
203,"I would tell my friends to eat prouducts with chicken , tofu and alternatives to beef because the process to get the meat from the beef is a lot more strenuous than one would think. The amount of energy that is put into attaining the meat is way more than that of chicken. ALso, the waste products of cows are much more of that humans and they leave nitrous oxide pollution in the world. Also, ecoli is very readily spread through beef, so it can contaminate several hamburgers very quickly.",25
204,"Sustainable energy seems like the best option because it helps to conserve energy, helps to reuse energy that the cows give out and is more healthy for the environment.",25
205,Get proteins in your diet such as boneless meats like chicken and plant based proteins like beans ,0
206,"Sustainable farming is the  best option because it uses its own resources to grow crops, feed cows, and produce milk and produce fuel to run the trucks. It saves us from using so many resources",20
207,The best option is organic/ natural because it is natural and contains the best source of nutrients,15
208,I would tell them to really just question where there food is coming from. make better choices when looking for foods to consume and support local small farms instead of corporation companies.,0
209,Eat meat as a protein source (but be careful of what you eat)  because unless done very carefully it is difficult to be a healthier vegetarian. ,10
210,The excess consumption of meat in America is hurting the environment and the people in it. I encourage my friends to green eat. ,20
211,I would tell my friends about sustainable farming because I think it is really smart how the famers are making use of two products from cows: the manure and the milk. I also like how some of the manure is used as a fertilizer while the rest is used as renewable gas and it is not harmful. ,20
212,"i would use the sustainable farming, because it doesn't hurt the earth as much because its using natural gas and natural resources. ",20
213,Sustainable farming is most definitely the best option because it saves the most energy and also helps the environment. Almost no materials go to waste with sustainable farming.,25
214,"Both videos were extremely informative, and provided different solutions to a major problem plaguing today's society. The first video explained the negative repercussions beef consumption has on our country (and the world), and how we can all do our part in reducing this damage. The second video showed sustainability in farming, in which little to no product goes to waste. I strongly believe that limiting cattle and meat production/ consumption AND increasing sustainability efforts are key for America's future. However, if I had to choose one option for my friends, I would recommend they limit their meat consumption. Like the video said, even the slight difference of cutting one burger out a week can make a difference. This solution would not require much effort, and small sacrifices can have monumental benefits. ",15
215,I would tell my friends that beef is not sustainable because most farms use the most cheap and efficient methods that they can.,10
216,"I would personally tell my friends to eat less meat and cheese per week. This is the better option for many reasons, especially because meat has greater amounts of saturated fats and therefore you could benefit from not eating as much of it. Along with this, you will still be able to help the ""cycle"" shown in the second video by allowing natural gas to be produced, but you will be creating less of the ""bad"" gas mentioned in the first video.",20
217,"I would tell my friends that going meatless is the best option. There are many reasons as to why, cows are the biggest production of methane aka greenhouse gasses. Animal slaughter is also very inhumane and mass done to supply for the demand of meat. ",20
218,I would try to tell my friends to try to eat meat and products that are cage free and organic because consuming these products are more beneficial for health and body.,15
219,"Based off of the videos my choice would be, to eat locally farm raised animal that are raised in a non hormones additive environment.  I would suggest this to my friends due to the fact that if the animal is happy and healthy, so will your body feel after eating the different kinds of proteins.",15
220,I would tell my friends that food grown from sustainable farming is the best option because it is better for you and the environment.,20
221,I would go with the first option,10
222,"I think that the best option is to cut out meat all together. Although, this isn't always as easy said then done. If someone cant cut out meat completely from their diet, I would say the next best thing would be supporting farms such as the one in the second video that is helping to limit the amount of methane gas polluting our world. ",15
223,I would say that the best option is to go with grass fed cows or anything that comes from a sustainable farm if they are going to eat red meat because it is better for the environment. Just cutting down on how much you eat or where you get it from make a huge difference. ,15
224,I would tell them that plant based protein is the best option,10
225,"I would tell my friend the best option is sustainable farming because, you know where your meat products are coming from, how they are treated, and you know the company invests a lot of time, research, and money in producing high quality products.",25
226,"Based on the videos I watched, in the first video there was a fact stated that Americans have started to eat more tofu, turkey and chicken rather than ground beef.  This is the best option because tofu, turkey and chicken is still giving our bodies the sources of protein we need and they're so much better for us.",5
227,Sustainable farming because it is not only more humane to the animals but it is beneficial to the environment and removes the majority of the pollution used.,20
228,"Eating sustainable farmed animals. Minimal to no beef, but grass fed if anything. Better to eat some pork/poultry and more plant based foods, which produce much less or no greenhouse gases which negatively effect the environment. ",20

500,People and companies have been making strides to improve the way meat/cows are handled. Not only with changing the way they are being fed but also in to using the whole aspect of the cow to sustain life and do it in a way that doesn't harm the planet. I personally don't consume beef that often but now being presented with the information that I was I am more motivated to buy from the company that is trying to be less of a burden on the planet. I believe that a meat diet is a better diet but to do all things in moderation.  ,10
501,"The second video is the best option that I would recommend my friend because there introduced a lot of benefits of cows. Not only people eat meat, some of products are also made from cow such as milk, cheese, ice cream and natural gas. ",10

I believe everyone is free to make their own choices but I would identify myself as vegan and I would suggest that my friend try going meatless while giving them all the information on why I did so as well as the benefits and let them make an informed decision. ,10
509,"I think the choice of recycling the cow manure into reusable fuel for vehicles is the better option.  Not only are we keeping up with beef and dairy production which will sustain the growing populations, but the reusable gas from the cow manure is a very viable source of clean energy for future automobile development.",20
510,"Reducing their amount of beef intake to help prevent pollution in the environment because the more beef we eat, the more cows are needed to meet that demand creating more pollution. ",15
511,Sustainable farming. It will have the greatest global impact as well as being important for future generations.,15
512,"Sustainable farming has benefits that extend that of what we are actually consuming from fast foo places of big franchise names offering protein packed menu items. The foot print livestock leaves on the world in order to continuously provide people with meat is land consuming and often not up to par with meat regulations. I would recommend they start looking more at their local farmer markets, in order to cut back on such heavy consumption of mutated hamburgers and meats.",0
513,To lower your beef consumption and think of grass fed beef as an alternative,10
514,"I would actually try and combine both ideas. Maybe we can cut back on the amount of eat we consume per week (such as having one meatless day per week) and utilize technology to eliminate the wastes that contribute to global warming. If I did have to pick one though, I lean towards the one using technology on their farm. It really is a great way to produce beef and fuel for their trucks at the same time. The whole idea of making a self sustainable farm with little to no waste appears to be more beneficial.  ",20
515,"Based upon the videos, I wouldn't recommend my friends to consume any type of beef or meat. Just seeing what these animals are put through just to produce food for us is enough to make me steer away from consuming it. ",15
516,There are great ideas of sustainability in the second video. I would say all of these options are worth looking into. There are best scenarios in both videos. ,10
517,The best option is the sustainable farming techniques. I felt like the first video made a few valid points but overall was a big stretch for the point it was trying to make. The hidden costs for cows/beef is clearly shown but relating that to pollution was a stretch. There are many other businesses with hidden pollutants the meat market is just one of them.  ,15
518,"I would say the best option is to eat meat. Meat is the best source of protein and also a good source for iron, vitamin B, and energy. Although eating meat does of cons, these cons are mainly based on if you eat to much red meat which is true for anything. If you eat to much of anything, it is bad for you. These videos talked mainly about the processing method and how it is hurting the environment and the bad gases the cows and their poop give off. However, the second video was about a guy telling you about his farm and he had a way to fix most of the problems the first video was talking about. The major one was the gases from the cows poop. He was using their poop to make gas for your car which is an all natural gas and so much better for the environment and has the same power that regular gas has. I found this very cool and interesting, I had no idea this even existed! Red meat is a complete protein which contains all the essential amino acids and saturated and monosaturated fats that have been shown to improve cholesterol levels. so eating red meats protects your heart. Also red meat contains omega-3 fatty acids which are protective against anxiety and depression, so eating red meat gives you energy and puts you in a happy mood. I believe that the cons for not eating meat is a lot worse than cons for eating meat. One con is the risk of vitamin deficiency. B12 is a hard vitamin to find and is mainly found in animal sources such as red meat. If you don't get enough of this vitamin, you may develop anemia. You may also experience weight loss or muscle wasting if dies does not contain enough protein. Even though losing weight may be a good thing, less than 20 percent of your daily calories come from healthy fat sources which red meat contains. In the end, I believe eating the right amount of red meat is a good and beneficial thing. ",15
519,"I believe it all is best in moderation, since there are also other consequences not explained in these videos to other aspects of the world.",0
520,I would tell them to do whats best for them.,0
521,"I would tell my friends to try and eat less meat. Meat seems to cause a lot of problems in the world and I think if we all decided to eat less meat then we could better the world. A person does not have to completely stop eating meat in order to help, but even just not eating meat for one day could help. ",10
522,That all the cow waste and everything else  is hurting our climate.,0
523,I would tell them the optimal diet is mixed and varies from person to person,0
524,"Personally, I am a vegan, so I am inclined to say that choosing to cut out meat may be the best option. However, I understand that that option may not be realistic, so I would suggest reducing the amount of beef eaten and choosing grass fed beef whenever possible, because these choices will help to reduce our affects on the environment. ",15
525,"I would say the best option would be to for my friends would be to try and go meatless and without cheese for one day per week. Thinking realistically, not many of my friends would just up and go vegan or without beef completely. I think incremental changes are best then it doesn't seem so daunting of a task and they might decide that it's something they would like to do long term.",10
526,I am much more likely to tell my friends that sustainable farming is the best option.,10
527,"It would be a hard one, because both provide good information. Although I would go with the first video, because if more people can learn about the excess gas released by the large amount of cattle being raised can be helpful. Which could lead to people eating less cattle and maybe reduce some of the amounts of green house gasses. ",15
528,I would recommend my friends to limit their consumption of meat per week and educate them about the greenhouse pollution and what we citizens can do to alter the numbers. As the video shows that buying red meat and consuming it has a bigger affect in pollution than cars. Over consumption of red meat is both bad for your body and for the nature. ,20
529,type here,0
530,I would be a vegetarian because seeing the effects it has on our environment and bodies is disgusting.,10
531,"I would probably tell them the un healthy consequences due to red meat, and how much that effects your health and the environment. I would choose to tell them this option because I personally do not eat red meat, and get my proteins through chicken or fish",20
532,"I believe the option the second video portrayed, with the endless cycle of processing manure and turning it into clean gas that then could be used to cart the products made on the farm all over. The main concern from the first video was about pollution from the cows and their manure and I believe that the second video took a lot of that out of the environment. ",20
533,"Sustainable farming, obviously. They are able to create clean energy without the addition of contaminate waste.",15
534,I would tell my friends The hidden cost of meat and I will also tell them how to fix the world and how by just simply taking one burger away a week could do so much difference in the world and the reason why I would tell them that is because not only will it make the world a better place for us but it will make a better place for the next generation behind us.,10
535,0,0
536,"It is obvious the meat industry has some extremely bad effects on the environment and on general health, but it is also obvious that counter efforts can be made to combat these effects through education on the subjects and creative thinking. It is unrealistic to say people should not eat meat, but buying meat from sources such as these can create a change that is much more achievable.",15
537,"Clearly the best option is the Dairy Farm Fair Oaks (Second Video). The whole process of what this farm is doing is solving a major pollution problem in the world today. Instead of the methane being released to pollute the air some of it is digested through pipes to power the farm and the rest of it is used as fuel that runs the farm's fleet of trucks. What can't be used after the digestion process, is put on the grounds as fertilization. This choice is the better option of the two regarding the conservation of our world. ",15
538,I feel that sustainable farming is the best choice. This is because it is overall the best choice for animals and us humans that are the consumers. ,20
539,"I feel as if cows are only helping the environment, it has its own recyclable energy and produces food for us ",15
540,"To be honest, I am going to eat meat regardless of what happens to our bodies and everything else. I was eating it all my life and shall continue. I mean if you've been doing it, why not keep doing it",10
541,Hamburger meat can be unsafe because of how its process of production so too much of this can be harmful even if it does provide protein. Avoiding it could lessen risk of e.coli spreading. ,0
542,"Based on what I heard in the videos, the best option is to cut down on beef. We drive the commercial farming of beef. The production of beef is costly, uses up too much of our natural resources, and is responsible for a vast majority of our greenhouse gases. The costs outweigh the benefits.  ",25
543,Organic meat is a good choice,10
544,"I would use Fair Oak Farms becuase it is cheaper. With them using the cows manure to make natural gas for the tanker trucks and using the left over manure for fertilization, which allows the cows to produce milk. Also with this process, it is better for the planet and climate change.",20
545,"I would say the best option is what ever works best with their lifestyle. I believe both options have their own pros and cons, so the decision is best left to them.",0
546,ill tell my friend to figure it out himself,0
547,"The best option is to go vegan, because a vegan diet produces the smallest carbon footprint and leads to the least amount of human and nonhuman animal suffering. ",20
548,Sustainable farming because most Americans won't want to make dietary changes.,10
549,The best option his to think everything through first. ,0
550,I would tell my friends to eat less beef and to eat mostly chicken and fish because those are meats that are easier on the body to digest and process.,10
551,I would tell them to continue eating meat because it is tasty and you only live once. None of the other stuff matters.,10
552,The choice I  would tell my friends is the best options would be the Fair Oaks option because it allows for manure to be reused for gasoline and invest back into the cow for it to produce milk. In turn it because a cycle in which nothing goes to waste and its reinvested to make a difference. ,15
553,"I would tell my friends that actual meat is better, simply because I don't believe in eating meatless meat.",10
554,Limiting the amount of meat you intake a week is the best option when eating beef because cows have become a huge source of greenhouse gasses and by just lowering the amount of beef you eat in a week can make a difference overall.,15
555,"The first video encourages listeners to eat less meat because of environmental and health reasons. The second video shows the use of cows for milk, and other dairy products and making manure renewable energy. Personally, I believe eating healthier plant based diets is a better option, but that is a personal opinion. I would not tell friends to change their diets and eat less beef. I think as a whole, I would tell them that the second option is the more realistic one, not everyone in the U.S. wants to eat plant based diets.",10
556,To eat healthier because its cheaper and will help your body in the long run. It takes meat a while to digest.While vegetables digest easily and live you feeling full and light.,10
557,I'm not sure honestly ,0
558,I would tell my friend to choose the second option because they are reusing manure to make something that is useful. ,15
559,Sustainable farming is clearly the more sensible and more earth friendly option. This type of farming turned one situation to another situation which is great for the earth and the economy in a sense. These farmers use the milk and manure to create this renewable natural gas that is very so much Clean Natural Gas that allows major opportunity instead of causing contamination. ,15

561,"Plant-based protein sources offer many benefits over even the most sustainable animal sources of protein. A concept in biology is the idea of energy levels, being that only 1/10th of the energy in one levels such as plants move up to the next level such as cows and other livestock. The energy level in cows in particular is only 1/10th of that in the entire energy level in plants used to feed them. Sources of protein such as beans and tofu are for more environmentally sustainable, which is my primary concern.",15
562,I believe the sustainable farming is the best option because it is not only healthier consuming the products from these cows but they also use the manure to produce a natural gas which powers these trucks to take milk all over. They are using things that most other farms would dispose of or just let sit there (manure) and using it as renewable energy. They are saving money rather than costing themselves and others more.,20

564,"After watching this video I learned how dangerous cow waste was to the environment which i never knew. If cow wastes accounts for 2/ of nitrogenous oxide that means by cutting down our burger consumption w could potentially save a lot of pollution that is caused. So i would have to tell them to go with option 2 because burgers are good sure, but we want the earth to be as happy and healthy as it can be for a long time. ",10
565,"I think the best option would be the second video's argument. The first video describes the harmful, unseen aspects of farming and cows, but you can't make everyone stop eating meat. At least in the other video, the farmer is capturing the gas to be reused for other things such as to gas trucks, and the leftovers go into the fertilizer to be reused. In the second video there is a lot of reuse/recycling being done since the farmer knows that cows produce gas and he's capturing it to use it for other benefits, rather than letting it escape into the air. It takes away one of the hidden facts to cows and a negative aspect towards the environment.",15
566,i know my friends really like burgers so maybe the sustainable farming would be best. The reason being that it is helping the earth as well as being able to feed people at the same time. I feel that it could be said as killing two birds with one stone.,10
567,"I think sustainable farming is the best option because while they are still using cows for produce such as milk, they are also using the negative byproduct from cows ( manure) and making it into something beneficial. Therefore, one would have a harder time arguing that cows create a lot of greenhouse gases when their manure is being used for the trucks that take their milk to suppliers.",15
568,"Sustainable farming/ranching methods definitely appear to be the superior option for the future.  If it is possible to both gain resources from cows and affect the environment in a minimal way, then it is my recommendation for the future.  ",15
569,Based on the videos I would tell my friends to limit the consumption of beef due to the negative effects it has on the environment. ,15
570,"Personally, I would tell them to do the more natural way, I believe that a more natural way to produce something is amazing! Also, the sustainability is much greater with lesser costs and you would be getting better health benefits from it.",0
571,Video 2 Because they are being environmentally friendly,15
572,The second one because you need to create a new thing to adapt to the new century.,10
573,"I believe the farm industry CAN primarily use renewable resources and make it better for our environment. However, the second video is only talking about that one location. How many locations that farm actually do all those things to be more green? Also, its very apparent that in our current time, the environment is not a priority to the government right now. It's too expensive and not convenient. So, I agree more with the first video. ",10
574,I think I would tell my friends about the second video because i feel like it is more educational and provided a more positive tone. I like how the second video was informing on ways to make the manure into something very useful instead of just polluting the earth.,15
575,The second video is the best choice for the environment because it does allow that company to turn manure into fuel which helps power the 18 wheelers that carry the milk around the country.  ,15
576,"Though I am a meat eater, I believe that the first choice about reducing the amount of meat being consumed would be the best choice. Not only is the amount of meat consumed bad for the environment, it is also bad for a person's health. Though it will take me a while, I plan on reducing the amount of meat I consumer on a daily basis.",20
577,I am personally vegan so I always share the benefits of a plant based diet. Or atleast list the benefits of heavily cutting back on meat consumption. For health and environmental reasons. ,20
578,"I would say that the sustainable farming would be the best option, due to the fact that they use a more economic way, turning the  manure into a natural gas. ",15
579,"There were claim made by both video that I agree with, but if I had to choose one it would be the second video. I am not a fan of mass production and feeding cows corn just to speed up production and of course profits. With that being said, I am really intrigued by the concept of turning manure into natural gas. I believe it's an innovative idea and I agree with what Gary, the CEO of Fair Oaks Farm stated; ""to survive in the 21st century you need sustainability, technology, creativity and innovation"" which is true. He's using a great way to turn waste into something productive. ",15
580,"I believe that if everyone made the effort to reduce their burger intake to one a week, it would help reduce the negative impact on the environment.",15
581,I would tell my friedns to be mindful of the types of beef consumed if they are going to eat it. Both videos displayed pros and cons of humans cow dependencies but there's really no right or wrong. I am in support of the organic/ non-gmo beef.,0
582,I would choose to not eat meat. At least once a day if not possible to go full vegan or vegetarian. Not only is it better for ourselves and our health but better to not put animals and our earth in harm. ,20
583,"The best option is to stop your consumption of red meat and reduce the need for cows. Without as many cows, there would be less methane gases in our already polluted earth.",15
584,I would tell them the second one because it seems to have all the pros and cons and it could answer all potential questions. ,10
585,"I would tell my friends to eat what they like, but to know what they are eating also. ",0
586,"I honestly have a hard time with this topic, because both have its pros and cons but I would have to choose option two because I think that is the most efficient.",20
587,"I'd say that it is important to eat meat (if they're ok with eating meat) every once in a while, but it's more important to break away from this meat-craze America has going on and include healthier variations in our diets.",0
588,"Trying to eat vegan/vegetarian as often as possible. While sustainable farming is better for the environment, it still has its effects. Cutting out meat/dairy as often as possible is what the world needs to do in order to combat climate change. ",15
589,Sustainable farming would be the better option so that we can preserve our environment and use food and resources wisely.,15
590,To tell them the truth,0
591,"I would tell my friend that it would be best to reduce their amount of meat intake. However, with meat being very abundant in American's diet, learning how to lessen the effects of the mass production of meat might be a better option. ",10
592,Based on the videos I would suggest to my friends to consume less beef and be more proactive in what they put into their bodies.  I did not know that such a simple thing as a hamburger could have such a negative effect on the Earth. ,10
593,"First of all, I would tell my friends to keep in mind the pros and cons of both videos, but I think the first one is the best option because you can control your intake of meat and getting others to be aware about their intake can help too. For the second video we don't really know how many farms are using that process.",10
594,"I think that sustainable farming was the way to go because it got rid of the greenhouse gasses being produced, reused it and limited the waste to a minute amount. With this option, people could still eat burgers and meat without as many repercussions. ",15
595,I would encourage friends to support sustainable farming because I feel that it is important to be mindful of the environment and animal welfare.,20
596,If it was solely based on the video I would tell them to switch to a meatless source because it would benefit the animals so they dont have to live to just be slaughtered but also meat has been proven to not actually be that healthy for humans,20
597,"After watching the two videos, I was more convinced with the second one. The farm is a great way to begin with reducing pollution. I believe that this is the best way to reduce waste because the people will not change their eating habits.",15
598,i would tell my friends eating healthy is very important in anything you do ,0
599,"I believe that the second video would be optimal in reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere. In fact, I believe that it would do way more in the long run. Everybody cutting back a burger a week will certainly help, but you can't really monitor that. If more farms followed suit and emphasized sustainability it would have a larger impact than the first option. I think if Borden and a few other large scale dairy companies really pushed sustainability it would have a huge impact on the amount of methane being produced.",15
600,"ill mainly go with and tell my friends to choose the 2 option, because its using the natural resources that they get from the cows in order to power everything around them. By using cow poop and such to fuel there fleet of trucks to feeding us as humans.",15
601,"Avoiding beef as much as possible, but doing what the farm does for what still is produced",10
